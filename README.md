# Stray Pets Adoption Application Project

## Overview
This application will facilitate the adoption of stray pets by connecting potential adopters with local shelters and rescue organizations. Users will be able to browse available pets, submit adoption applications, and receive updates on their application status. Additionally, adopters can upload updates on their adopted pets’ status, helping to create a community of responsible pet owners. Users can also report stray pets they encounter and request assistance for pet transfers.
